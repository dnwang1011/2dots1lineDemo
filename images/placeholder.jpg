This is a placeholder for an image file. In an actual implementation, this would be:

- A 80x80 pixel image
- Used in the resource card components
- Show relevant imagery for the resource topic (e.g., science experiments, educational activities)
- Have rounded corners and fit the UI color scheme

Since we can't create an actual JPG here, the UI is designed to handle missing images by showing the background color.
